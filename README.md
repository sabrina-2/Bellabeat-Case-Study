<ins>Data sources used</ins>

-Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data (used for analysis):     
Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016.  
Limitations : Low since small sample size and important information, such as age, gender, location, etc of participants is unknown. 

-CDC data:       
Data about health statistics is used

<ins>Processing Data</ins>

All the csv files were cleaned using Microsoft Excel. I looked for null values in the rows. I also split the date time column into two separate column, one for data in the short date format and one for time.

I then loaded the data in Google BigQuery after which I proceeded to use SQL for analysis ( Present in SQL code)   
The following steps were taken:    
1- I viewed all the data present to make sure all the data was imported correctly   

2- I checked the number of distinct id in each csv file. Results:
       -dailyActivity : 33      
       -dailyCalories : 33        
       -dailySteps : 33       
       -sleepDay : 24      
       -weightLog : 8         
This shows that the data is inconsistent as we are told that there are 30 participants. Some data has more entries while some have missing data.    

3- I then checked the average stat for the data.      
       - Average Daily Steps : 7638 steps. CDC recommends 10000 steps a day so that mark is not reached          
       - Average Active Minutes : 227.52 minutes out of which 21.16 minutes has very active activity. CDC recommends 75 minutes of vigorous activity a week so users                                   are reaching that goal.       
       -Average Calories burned : 2304 calories. 3500 calories are required to burn to lose 1 pound of weight 
       -Average Sleep Hours : Roughly 7 hours. This value is within CDC recommendation      
       -Avergae BMI - 25.19 which falls under the overweight category.    

4- I then proceeded to find the relationships between different data and visualized the results using tableau.           
- Relationship between Average Activity and Average Calories burned : There is a positive correlation between average activity and the average calories burned.

- Relationship between Average Steps and Average Calories burned: There is a positive correlation between average steps and average calories burned.

- Relationship between Average Activity and Total Hours of Sleep : No correlation

- Relationship between Average Activity and BMI (Not reliable due to small dataset) : Negative correlation between Average Activity and BMI

Other data insights: According to a new report by market research firm NPD Group, 36 percent of people who own fitness trackers in the U.S. are 35 to 54 years old and are predominantly women. Social media platforms used mostly by people in this demographic are Youtube and Facebook. 


<ins>Final conclusions</ins>

-Bellabeat should concentrate more of their online marketing towards Youtube and Facebook as majority of women who own a fitness device are on that platform.   
-Currently, Bellabeat app provides data on a user's health. A new feature should be added which will encourage users to reach the health levels as recommended by the CDC.        
If a user has below 10000 steps, they should be notified and recommended to reach that level           
If a user has below 7 hours of sleep, they should be notified and recommended to reach that level                         
If a user has below 75 minutes of vigorous activity a week, they should be notified and recommended to reach that level           
A section can be created for personal goals and Bellabeat can encourage them to reach that goal. For instance, if someone wants to lose 10 pounds, the calories needed to burn everyday to lose that weight in a healthy manner can be added as a metric to the app. From our data, we know that more steps and activity levels can help in burning more calories. This info can then be used to add a metric for recommended steps and activity level required to lose weight.           
-BMI tracker should be added for Bellabeat app.         
-A 30 day free trial subscription should be added for Bellabeat membership.        
-Discounted rates should be provided for Bellabeat products for people who refer the products to someone else. This will encourage the users to market the products to other people        
-Offer a package deal with discounts when a user purchases multiple Bellabeat product
